        <h1>Is It Too Late to Buy Axie Infinity (AXS) in 2022?</h1>
        <p>Suppose you look at the various price predictions for Axie Infinity. In that case, many experts believe that AXS in the future can still
            provide the best opportunities for crypto investors and traders.
        </p>
        <p>With a lot of cooperation in the plan to expand the network, the prospects for AXS in the future may look good. However, before you plan to buy and invest
            in cryptocurrencies, remember that the price predicitons are based on algorithms that track past performance to predict the future.
        </p>
        <p>The crypto market is known to be very volatile, and predictions based on this algorithm may not necessarily be proven true. Before making an 
            investment decision on any crypto asset, you should always do in-depth research, looking at the latest project initiatives that include collaborations, partnership deals, and
            fundamentals. 
        </p>
        <p>DigitalCoinPrice predicts that the Axie Infinity (AXS) coin will touch by 62.47 USD by 2022, with projections from 2023 to 2026 set at 69 USD, 71 USD, 92 USD amd 85 USD, respectively.</p>
        <p>To answer that question, it is never too late to buy Axie Infinity (AXS) as long as you are ready to take and accept risks. It is important not to invest using the money
            for daily needs, and it is better to invest with cold cash.

        <h1>Axie Infinity Developer Acknowledges Sharp Usage Drop</h1>
        <p>Axie Infinity developer, Sky Mavis, tweeted some important information last night, responding to Wagner James Au tweet citing Arcane Research,
            which originally claimed that the "play to earn" game had slipped beneath 1000 weekly active users. On the contrary, COO Aleksander Leonard Larsen 
            said that the accurate number is currently 588,000 DAU / 1.5 million DAU. 
         </p>

         <p>Notably, this is still a major drop in usage for Axie Infinity, based on the Google Chart that Larsen shared to bolster this claim: According to the data,
            Axie Infinity's daily active users have shrunk from 1,331,453 on April 11 down to 588,087 on June 6.
         </p>
         <p><i>"We are in a major transition period in our game, narrative and economy, as well as it being a macro bear market"</i>, Axie Infinity product lead Philip La replied 
        in the Twitter thread, acknowledging the drop.<i>"The user drop is a function of all of these, each of which have their own complex nuances."</i></p>

        <h1>Axie Infinity Esports Tournament Rocks the Philippines</h1>
        <h2>Sixteen players participated in the two-day Axie Infinity Origins Championship that featured a 400 $AXS prize pool.</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Popular Ronin Network, PlayandEarn blockchain game, Axie Infinity, recently held one of its biggest Esports tournament in the Philippines.</p>
        <p>Half of the player pool got invited to the two-day event from June 11-12, while the other half had to get past a qualification round held the month
            before. The Axie Infinity Origins Championship, which had a 400 $AXS prize pool, got Axie's Philippine Lead, Nix Eniego, really excited for the game's future
            and its impact on the community.
        </p>
        <p><i>"I see the first-ever Axie Origin PH Championship as a success,"</i> Nix told 
        <a href="https://www.bsc.news">BSC News.</a><i>"Seeing the entire team and top competitors come together and pour everything
            they have was inspiring. Our eSports team [and] our production partners did a phenomenal job in giving the #AxiePH community
            a taste of competitive Axie Origin eSports with some entertainment sprinkled on top."</i>

        <p>Both finalists needed to qualify to join the tournament. But in the end, ADRD, who had to climb the lower brackets to reach the finals, bested undefeated P4TRICK
            in 4 matches. The Polish player saw himself in 0-1 deficit to start the finals but rallied behind his unique team compositions and sealed the three-game win streak with his blood moon poison strategy to take home the trophy.

        <h1>What Lunacia Land Gameplay Is Bringing With It?</h1>
        <p>According to the roadmap, Axie Infinity Land Gameplay was anticipated to be released in 2022.</p>
        <p>In Axie Infinity Land Gameplay, players will explore the open world to discover resource nodes or "Chimera".</p>
        <p>Chimeras are enemies in game which the Axies will battle against. Players will chose the team of their creatures to fight against them. Fols will have teleportation option for their Axies.</p>
        <p>Once teleported, Axies cannot be sent back home via teleportation, and they have to travel home back, which might take a few days. Mean players can teleport the creatures in the 
            battle instantly, but cannot do that immediately if they desire to send Axies back to base.
        </p>
        <p>Additionally, the update will include off-chain pawn Axies to organize various tasks on the Land. In brief, Axie Infinity Land Gameplay will allow folks to take ownership
            of a peice of land and use it to develop resources which can be upgraded later in game.
        </p>
        <p>This new Axie Infinity Land Gameplay is similar to the Clash of Clans, a battle strategy game. Players in CoC gather resources, make raids, and defend their bases from other players.</p>
        <p>Recently, Ronin Bridge of Axie Infinity was attacked by the hackers, where it received a damage of over $625 million worth of crypto assets. But as we can witness in the chart below, users around
            that time remained intact and did not abandon the project. This represents how trustworthy Axie Infinity is, and the initiation of the Axie Infinity Land Gameplay is anticipated to lure more players into
            the ecosystem.
        </p>
        <img src="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-105.png">
        <p>Folks can get their hands over the Lunacia Lands on Axie Infinity marketplace, but the gameplay is not active on the pieces of these NFTs yet.</p>
