        <h2>Axie Infinity Roadmap: Lunicia In The Future</h2>

        <p>Looking at the roadmap, Axie Infinity will receive a plethora of game-changing updates in the future.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Even with the variety of new NFT projects launching, Axie Infinity remains near the top of the NFT charts. Axie Infinity
            saw a huge surge in its player base in mid-2021 which is nearing a total of 1 million daily users. Interests also surged in Axie Infinity land
            for the metaverse towards the end of the year. To maintain this, Axie Infinity has laid out some ambitious plans for the future of Axie. 
        </p>
        <h3>Axie Infinity Roadmap</h3>
        <p>
            The latest large-scale update to Axie Infinity came in the form of AXS Staking, which launched in September 2021. By staking AXS, players can earn rewards in the form of new AXS.
            The next ambitious project is called <b>Project K</b> which involves the long-awaited land gameplay. Previous roadmaps suggested Axie Infinity's land gameplay would launch in Q1 2020,
            but the community alpha was then pushed back to Q4 2021. However, the roadmap now gives the land gameplay community alpha a generic '2022' release window.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><i>"Land is so important for the future of the community, economy, and we want to make sure it provides the experience you deserve."</i>, Sky Mavis said.</p>
        <p>In the long-term, Sky Mavis has split Project K into three phases:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Phase 1:</b> Simulation and Land Management. This includes gathering resources, building and trading.</li>
            <li><b>Phase 2:</b> Additional management gameplay, such as skill trees, jobs, and co-op.</li>
            <li><b>Phase 3:</b> Further group gameplay, through battles to conquer.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Perhaps the most major change added in the land gameplay update will be the transition to a 3rd art style. You can see the teaser below.

       <p>Later in 2022, Sky Mavis will release the Lunacia SDK Alpha. This will allow a small group of players access to a map editor in which players can use Axie Infinity
        assets to create games, before saving them as tradeable NFTS. The developers have not given a date for the full release of Lunacia SDK. 
       </p>
       <br>
       <p>Sky Mavis also hopes to launch an iOS/Android Version of Axie Infinity this year, although you can already play Axie Infinity via mobile devices.</p>
       <br>
       <p>At some point in 2022, we can expect more governance features in Axie Infinity - potentially in the form of Axie Infinity DAO. By 2023, Sky Mavis says it will not hold the majority
        vote in Axie Infinity.
